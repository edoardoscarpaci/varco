varco_core.event.domain
=======================
Domain-level events emitted by ``AsyncService`` for create, update, and
delete operations.

These events are built on top of the general-purpose event system and are
published automatically by ``AsyncService`` after each mutating operation
commits.  User code never constructs them directly — they are assembled
inside the service using the ReadDTO produced by the assembler.

Event hierarchy::

    Event
    └── EntityEvent              — base for all entity lifecycle events
        ├── EntityCreatedEvent   — emitted after a successful create()
        ├── EntityUpdatedEvent   — emitted after a successful update()
        └── EntityDeletedEvent   — emitted after a successful delete()

Channel convention
------------------
``AsyncService`` publishes domain events to a channel derived from the
entity class name (lowercase), e.g. ``"post"``, ``"user"``, ``"order"``.

This gives subscribers two independent routing axes:

- **By event type** (what happened):
  ``@listen(EntityCreatedEvent)`` — all creates across all entities.

- **By channel** (which entity):
  ``@listen(EntityEvent, channel="order")`` — all order events (create +
  update + delete).

- **Narrowed**:
  ``@listen(EntityCreatedEvent, channel="order")`` — only order creates.

- **Wildcard**:
  ``@listen(EntityEvent, channel="*")`` — every entity lifecycle event.

Tenant isolation
----------------
``EntityEvent.tenant_id`` is populated from ``ctx.metadata["tenant_id"]``
at event construction time inside the service.  Events produced outside a
tenant context (e.g. background jobs, admin operations) carry ``None``.

Consumers that need per-tenant isolation should filter by this field::

    @listen(EntityCreatedEvent, channel="post")
    async def on_post_created(self, event: EntityCreatedEvent) -> None:
        if event.tenant_id != self._expected_tenant:
            return  # skip events belonging to other tenants

This field is also **critical for field-level encryption** — consumers
receiving events with encrypted ``payload`` fields must use it to select
the correct per-tenant decryption key.

Correlation ID
--------------
``EntityEvent.correlation_id`` is auto-populated from the active tracing
context (``current_correlation_id()``) at event construction time inside
the service.  No caller action is required — the ID is threaded through
automatically when ``correlation_context()`` is active on the request.

Payload
-------
``EntityCreatedEvent`` and ``EntityUpdatedEvent`` carry a ``payload`` dict
— the result of ``assembler.to_read_dto(entity).model_dump()``.  This is
the serialized ReadDTO at the time of the operation.  Downstream consumers
can reconstruct the full DTO from this dict.

``EntityDeletedEvent`` does NOT carry a payload — the entity no longer
exists and the ReadDTO cannot be reconstructed.  The ``pk`` field alone
identifies what was deleted.

Thread safety:  ✅ All events are immutable (Pydantic frozen model).
Async safety:   ✅ Immutable — safe to pass across coroutines.

class EntityEvent(Event):
    """
    Base class for all entity lifecycle events.

    Carries the identity of the affected entity (``entity_type``, ``pk``)
    and an optional correlation ID for request tracing.

    Subscribing to ``EntityEvent`` receives ALL subclass events
    (``EntityCreatedEvent``, ``EntityUpdatedEvent``, ``EntityDeletedEvent``)
    because ``InMemoryEventBus`` uses ``isinstance`` for class-based dispatch.

    Attributes:
        entity_type:     Short name of the domain class, e.g. ``"Post"``.
                         Matches ``type(entity).__name__`` on the service side.
        pk:              Primary key of the affected entity.  Type is ``Any``
                         because PKs may be ``int``, ``UUID``, or composite.
        tenant_id:       Tenant that owns the affected entity, populated from
                         ``ctx.metadata["tenant_id"]`` by the service layer.
                         ``None`` when the event originates outside a tenant
                         context (background jobs, admin CLI, etc.).
                         Consumers that handle events with encrypted ``payload``
                         fields **must** use this to select the decryption key.
        correlation_id:  Active request correlation ID, or ``None`` if the
                         event was produced outside a ``correlation_context``.

    Edge cases:
        - ``tenant_id`` is ``None`` for non-tenant services — consumers must
          handle this gracefully rather than assuming all events are tenanted.
        - Both ``tenant_id`` and ``correlation_id`` default to ``None`` so that
          events produced outside service context (e.g. tests, scripts) remain
          valid without supplying infra metadata.

    Attributes:
