===============
Distributed locking abstractions for cross-process coordination.

Problem
-------
``asyncio.Lock`` is process-local — multiple replicas of the same service can
race on shared resources (e.g. inventory reservation, idempotency slot
allocation, leader election).  Without cross-process coordination, exclusive
operations execute concurrently on different replicas, corrupting shared state.

Solution
--------
``AbstractDistributedLock`` defines a two-shape API::

    try_acquire(key, ttl) → bool        — non-blocking; False if already held
    acquire(key, ttl, timeout)          — blocking; raises LockNotAcquiredError

Each acquire call returns a ``LockHandle`` that the caller uses to release.
The handle carries an opaque token that the backend checks before releasing —
preventing a holder whose TTL expired from accidentally releasing a new holder's
lock (the "phantom release" bug).

DESIGN: separate try_acquire / acquire shapes over a single acquire(blocking=)
    ✅ The two shapes have different return types — a boolean vs None.
       A single acquire(blocking=bool) would need Union return types or
       overloads, making the API harder to typecheck and use.
    ✅ try_acquire is useful in "skip if busy" patterns where the caller simply
       skips work if the lock is contended — no exception needed.
    ✅ acquire is useful in "must proceed exclusively" patterns where giving up
       is not acceptable — raising LockNotAcquiredError on timeout is cleaner
       than returning False and leaving the caller to decide what to do.
    ❌ Two methods instead of one — minimal API surface increase.

DESIGN: LockHandle over returning a raw token
    ✅ LockHandle is a context manager — ``async with handle:`` auto-releases.
    ✅ LockHandle carries the key alongside the token — backend doesn't need
       a separate argument on release.
    ✅ LockHandle is typed — callers can't accidentally pass the wrong token to
       the wrong lock backend.
    ❌ Allocates one extra object per acquire — negligible overhead.

Components
----------
``LockNotAcquiredError``
    Raised by ``acquire()`` when the lock is not acquired within ``timeout``.

``LockHandle``
    Returned by ``try_acquire()`` and ``acquire()``.  Context manager that
    calls ``release()`` on exit.

``AbstractDistributedLock``
    ABC — two abstract methods: ``try_acquire`` and ``release``.

``InMemoryLock``
    asyncio-based implementation backed by a dict of asyncio.Lock per key.
    For single-process use and tests only.

Usage::

    lock = InMemoryLock()

    handle = await lock.acquire("inventory:item_42", ttl=30)
    try:
        await reserve_item(item_id=42)
    finally:
        await handle.release()

    # Or with context manager:
    async with await lock.acquire("inventory:item_42", ttl=30):
        await reserve_item(item_id=42)

Thread safety:  ⚠️ InMemoryLock uses asyncio.Lock (lazy-created per key).
                    Not safe for multi-process setups — use RedisLock.
Async safety:   ✅ All abstract methods are ``async def``.
