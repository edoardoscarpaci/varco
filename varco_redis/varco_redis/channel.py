====================
Redis-backed ``ChannelManager`` implementation.

``RedisChannelManager`` provides a ``ChannelManager`` interface for Redis Pub/Sub.
Redis Pub/Sub channels are ephemeral — they exist only while subscribers are
connected and cannot be "created" or "deleted" at the broker level.

For this reason ``RedisChannelManager`` maintains a **local registry** of declared
channels and mirrors the ``ChannelManager`` contract.  This is useful for:

- Bootstrap verification: ensuring expected channels are declared before services start.
- Introspection: listing channels known to a specific deployment.
- Consistency: providing the same API across all backends regardless of Redis's
  ephemeral channel model.

DESIGN: local registry over real broker queries
    ✅ Redis PUBSUB CHANNELS works but returns only ACTIVE channels (ones with
       live subscribers).  A declared-but-idle channel would not appear.
    ✅ No admin credentials needed — Redis Pub/Sub has no ACL for channel creation.
    ✅ Symmetric with KafkaChannelManager — same interface, different behaviour.
    ❌ Local state is lost on restart — ``declare_channel`` calls are not persisted.
       If persistence is needed, store them in a Redis SET (future enhancement).

Thread safety:  ❌  Not thread-safe.  Use from a single event loop.
Async safety:   ✅  All public methods are ``async def``.

#
# DESIGN: alias over new class
#   ✅ No code duplication — same fields, same env prefix.
#   ✅ Users can pass the same settings object to both bus and manager.
#   ❌ The alias is less discoverable than a distinct class name.
#      Documented here so users know the manager and bus share settings.

class RedisChannelManager(ChannelManager):
    """
    Redis Pub/Sub channel management via a local registry.

    Implements ``ChannelManager`` for Redis.  Because Redis Pub/Sub channels
    are ephemeral, this class maintains a local in-memory registry of declared
    channels.  No admin credentials are required.

    Lifecycle:
        start / stop are no-ops for Redis (no persistent admin connection
        needed) but are implemented for ``ChannelManager`` protocol compliance::

            async with RedisChannelManager(settings) as manager:
                await manager.declare_channel("orders")
                channels = await manager.list_channels()

    Args:
        settings: Redis connection settings.  Defaults to
                  ``RedisEventBusSettings()`` (reads from ``VARCO_REDIS_*`` env).

    Thread safety:  ❌  Not thread-safe — the local registry is a plain dict.
    Async safety:   ✅  All public methods are ``async def``.

    Edge cases:
        - ``declare_channel`` does not create anything on the Redis broker —
          channels appear automatically when the first subscriber connects.
        - ``delete_channel`` removes the channel from the local registry only;
          it cannot force active subscribers to disconnect.
        - ``channel_exists`` and ``list_channels`` reflect the local registry,
          NOT the actual live Redis pub/sub state.
        - Local registry is not persisted — it resets on object construction.
